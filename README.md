# Architecture Overview

## Core Components

### `LiveStreamViewController.swift`
The main streaming interface containing:
- **Camera Management**: Safe switching between front/back cameras
- **Stream Control**: Start/stop broadcasting with state management  
- **Network Handling**: Connection monitoring and automatic retry logic
- **UI Management**: Modern controls with real-time feedback

### Key Classes

**`UltraModernNotificationView`**
- iOS 18-style notifications with blur effects
- Haptic feedback integration
- Auto-dismiss with smooth animations

**`ModernNotificationManager`** 
- Centralized notification system
- Multiple styles (success, error, warning, info)
- Thread-safe presentation

**`StreamState` Enum**
- Comprehensive state management (idle, connecting, publishing, etc.)
- UI behavior mapping for each state
- Progress indication and user interaction control

### Streaming Profiles
```Swift
enum Preset {
  case hd_1080p_30fps_5mbps // Premium quality
  case hd_720p_30fps_3mbps // High quality
  case sd_540p_30fps_2mbps // Standard quality
  case sd_360p_30fps_1mbps // Data-saver quality
}
```

# Technical Implementation

## Stream Setup Process

1. **Permission Handling**
```Swift
requestCameraPermission { [weak self] granted in
    if granted {
        self?.setupStreamingEngine()
    } else {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self?.showPermissionAlert()
        }
    }
}
```

2. **RTMP Configuration**
```Swift
rtmpStream = RTMPStream(connection: rtmpConnection)
configureStream(preset: self.preset)
rtmpStream.attachCamera(cameraDevice)
rtmpStream.attachAudio(audioDevice)
```

3. **Connection Management**
```Swift
rtmpConnection.addEventListener(.rtmpStatus, selector: #selector(rtmpStatusHandler), observer: self)
rtmpConnection.connect("rtmps://live.fastpix.app:443/live")
```

## Crash Protection Features

### Camera Switching Protection
```Swift
private var isCameraSwitching = false
private var cameraAttachmentInProgress = false

private func attachCamera() {
guard !isCameraSwitching && !cameraAttachmentInProgress else { return }

// Safe camera switching logic

}
```

### Status Interaction Safety
```Swift
private func handleConnectingStateInteraction() {
guard isViewLoaded, view.window != nil, presentedViewController == nil else { return }

// Safe UI interaction during connection states

}
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Network Resilience
- **Network Change Detection**: Seamless transition between WiFi and cellular
- **Connection Timeout**: 15-second timeout with user options
- **Poor Network Handling**: Quality reduction and user notifications

### UI Protection
- **Thread Safety**: All UI updates on main thread with proper guards
- **State Validation**: Operations only allowed in appropriate states  
- **Debouncing**: Prevention of rapid button taps and concurrent operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors for edge cases

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-time Metrics
- **FPS Monitoring**: Live frame rate display
- **Bitrate Tracking**: Current upload speed in kbps
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for stream health
- **Quality Adaptation**: Automatic bitrate adjustment notifications

## UI Features

### Modern Design Elements
- **Blur Effects**: Ultra-thin material backgrounds
- **Glass Morphism**: Translucent containers with subtle borders
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile responses for user actions
- **Smooth Animations**: Spring-based transitions and transforms

### Accessibility
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Distinct UI sections and controls
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded connection states
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly notification system
- **Touch Targets**: Properly sized interactive elements

## State Management

The app uses a comprehensive state machine to handle streaming lifecycle:
```Swift
enum StreamState {
  case idle // Ready to start streaming
  case connecting // Attempting RTMP connection
  case connected // Connected, starting stream
  case publishing // Live streaming active
  case reconnecting // Recovering from connection loss
  case stopping // Ending stream gracefully
  case waitingForNetwork // Poor network, waiting for improvement
}
```

# Platform Integration

- **Background Handling**: Proper app lifecycle management
- **Orientation Support**: All orientations with persistence
- **Screen Wake Lock**: Prevents sleep during streaming
- **Audio Session**: Proper audio handling for streaming
- **Network Monitoring**: Real-time connectivity status

## Testing Considerations
- **Physical Device Required**: Camera and streaming features need real hardware
- **Network Conditions**: Test various connection scenarios
- **Battery Impact**: Monitor power consumption during long streams
- **Memory Usage**: Profile for memory leaks in streaming components

# Performance Optimizations

## Memory Management
- **Weak References**: Proper memory handling in async callbacks

- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient RTMP connection reuse
- **Bandwidth Detection**: Network quality assessment

# Support & Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

1. **Black Screen During Streaming**
   - Check camera permissions
   - Verify stream key validity
   - Restart the app

2. **Connection Failures**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify RTMP endpoint accessibility
   - Try different network (WiFi/4G)

3. **Camera Switching Crashes** 
   - Fixed in latest version with crash protection
   - Avoid rapid camera switching during connection
